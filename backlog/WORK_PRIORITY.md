Working on **Task 4: Browser Extension Overhaul**

### Completed (Archived)

- âœ… Task 4.1: Document current browser extension project layout and functionality
- âœ… Task 4.2: Document code structure and identify refactoring opportunities  
- âœ… Task 4.3: Refactor code to improve modularity and feature encapsulation

### In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Task 4.4: Research and implement alternative to Playwright for extension testing
  - Researched alternatives and selected Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)

   - Depends on completing Task 4.4
   - Add unit tests for all new functional modules
   - Add CDP integration tests for multi-page navigation
   - Add tests for all navigation types

2. **Task 4.6: Document main functionality with links to key modules** [MEDIUM]
   - Can start now (Task 4.3 complete)
   - Document the refactored module structure
   - Add links to key modules in documentation

3. **Task 4.7: Clean up test scripts, dead code and outdated documentation** [LOW]
   - Final cleanup task
   - Remove old Playwright tests if CDP works well
   - Update all documentation

## Other Backlog Tasks (Not Started)

- Task 1: Investigate adding MCP functionality for RAG on webpage history
- Task 2: Migrate IDE browser communication from HTTP to Native Messaging
- Task 3: Release project as npm package
- Task 3.1: Tidy up repository structure

## Recent Achievements
