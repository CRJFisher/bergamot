## Description

Implement a SQL-like query interface that allows users to retrieve custom data from their browsing history database. This will provide power users with flexible data access for analytics, research, and custom integrations. The interface should also be exposed via an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to enable AI assistants and other tools to query the browsing data programmatically.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] SQL-like query parser implemented for browsing database
- [ ] Support for common SQL operations (SELECT WHERE ORDER BY GROUP BY LIMIT)
- [ ] Query execution against the local browsing history database
- [ ] MCP server implementation with browsing data query tools
- [ ] Schema documentation that fits within MCP tool descriptions
- [ ] Security measures to prevent SQL injection and data leaks
- [ ] Query result formatting in JSON and tabular formats
- [ ] Example queries and documentation for users
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets
