## Description

Create a VS Code command that allows users to search for webpages stored in the database and display them in a selectable dropdown list. Include a button to add selected webpages to the current document. This enables users to choose which webpages to add to their documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] VS Code command for webpage search
- [x] Search functionality across webpage database
- [x] Dropdown list display of search results
- [x] Button to add selected page to document
- [x] Integration with existing webpage storage

## Implementation Plan

## Implementation Plan

1. Create VS Code command 'pkm-assistant.searchWebpages'
2. Implement search input using vscode.window.showInputBox
3. Query the memory store for matching webpages
4. Display results using vscode.window.showQuickPick
5. Implement 'Add to Document' functionality
6. Register command in extension activation
7. Add keyboard shortcut configuration
8. Test search functionality with various queries

## Implementation Notes

## Implementation Notes

Created VS Code commands and UI features for searching webpages stored in the database.

### Features Implemented

1. **Search Command**: 
   - Command ID: pkm-assistant.searchWebpages
   - Uses vscode.window.showInputBox for search query input
   - Searches in LanceDB memory store using semantic similarity
   - Shows results in vscode.window.showQuickPick dropdown

2. **Search Functionality**:
   - Queries the webpage_content namespace in memory store
   - Limits results to 20 for performance
   - Shows title, URL, and content preview for each result
   - Handles empty results gracefully

3. **Add to Document**:
   - Inserts selected webpage as markdown link at cursor position
   - Format: [Title](URL)

### Technical Decisions

- Used existing LanceDBMemoryStore for search instead of direct DuckDB queries
- Implemented as a command rather than a view for simplicity
- Used standard VS Code UI components for better integration

### Files Modified

- src/webpage_search_commands.ts - New file with search command implementation
- src/extension.ts - Register command and pass memory_store
- package.json - Added command definition
