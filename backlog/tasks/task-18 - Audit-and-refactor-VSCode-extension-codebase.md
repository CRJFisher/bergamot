## Description

Perform a comprehensive code audit of the VSCode extension to improve code quality, maintainability, and test coverage. This includes removing dead code, simplifying complex functions, ensuring consistent coding standards, and adding missing test coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All dead/unused code identified and removed
- [ ] Complex functions refactored for clarity (cyclomatic complexity < 10)
- [ ] Test coverage increased to >80% for all modules
- [ ] Coding standards applied consistently (snake_case for TypeScript)
- [ ] All TypeScript 'any' types replaced with proper types
- [ ] All eslint warnings resolved
- [ ] Documentation added for public APIs
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks identified and optimized

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze codebase for dead code using coverage reports and static analysis
2. Identify and document all eslint warnings and TypeScript 'any' usage
3. Measure current test coverage and identify gaps
4. Refactor complex functions (high cyclomatic complexity)
5. Apply snake_case naming convention consistently
6. Replace all 'any' types with proper TypeScript types
7. Add comprehensive tests for uncovered code paths
8. Document all public APIs and module interfaces
9. Profile and optimize performance bottlenecks
10. Final cleanup and verification
