## Description

Add comprehensive end-to-end tests for the VSCode extension's native messaging module to verify the complete communication flow. This requires mocking the browser extension side and testing that messages can be properly received and processed over the native messaging protocol. Testing from the browser extension side wasn't possible in the CDP testing environment, so we need to test from the VSCode extension side.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] E2E test suite for native messaging module exists
- [ ] Tests mock browser extension messages
- [ ] Tests verify message reception over native messaging protocol
- [ ] Tests verify message processing and responses
- [ ] Tests cover error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Test documentation added
