## Description

Assess the current RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation in the MCP server and identify areas for improvement to enhance retrieval accuracy, performance, and relevance of results. Research industry best practices for RAG evaluation to ensure comprehensive assessment using established methodologies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Best practices for RAG evaluation researched and documented
- [ ] Chunk-size reviewed and optimized e.g. how does it perform if we use document and paragraph chunks?
- [ ] Current RAG system performance metrics documented using industry-standard evaluation methods
- [ ] Bottlenecks and limitations identified through systematic evaluation
- [ ] Improvement plan created with specific optimizations based on best practices
- [ ] At least 2-3 improvements implemented
- [ ] Performance improvements measured and documented using appropriate metrics
