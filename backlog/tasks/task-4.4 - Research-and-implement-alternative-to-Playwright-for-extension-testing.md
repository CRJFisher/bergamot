## Description

Research alternatives to Playwright that can persist extension state between page navigations. If found, implement the alternative and expand tests to include multi-page sessions and state tracking in background.ts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Alternative testing frameworks researched and documented
- [ ] Comparison of frameworks including state persistence capabilities
- [ ] Decision made on framework selection
- [ ] If alternative chosen then implemented and configured
- [ ] If alternative chosen then multi-page session tests created
- [ ] If alternative chosen then background.ts state tracking tests implemented
- [ ] If no alternative then document Playwright limitations and workarounds
