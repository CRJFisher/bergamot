## Description

Achieve excellent and thorough test coverage for all functionality including unit tests and integration tests covering all main features

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test coverage metrics established and measured
- [ ] Unit tests cover all modules and functions
- [ ] Integration tests cover all main user workflows
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios tested
- [ ] Test coverage report shows >90% coverage
- [ ] All tests pass reliably

## Implementation Notes

Created comprehensive unit test suite for all functional modules achieving 89.37% overall coverage:
- Added tests for tab_history_manager (100% coverage)
- Added tests for navigation_detector (86.15% coverage)
- Added tests for data_collector (81.48% coverage)
- Added tests for configuration_manager (100% coverage)
- Added tests for message_router (100% coverage)
