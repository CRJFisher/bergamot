## Description

Tidy up the codebase by removing unused test scripts, dead code, and updating or removing outdated documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dead code identified and removed
- [ ] Unused test scripts removed
- [ ] Outdated documentation updated or removed
- [ ] Dependencies audited and unused ones removed
- [ ] Code formatting standardized across project

## Implementation Plan

1. Remove old Playwright test files
2. Clean up unused dependencies
3. Remove dead code from refactoring
4. Update or remove outdated documentation
5. Standardize code formatting

## Implementation Notes

Cleaned up project by removing:
- Old Playwright test files and configuration
- Compiled JavaScript files from TypeScript sources  
- Unused dependencies: cheerio, webextension-polyfill, @playwright/test
- Empty src/navigation directory
- Test artifacts (playwright-report, test-results)
- Unused setup-dom.ts file
- Playwright fixtures directory

Updated package.json to remove unused dependencies and scripts. Console.log statements retained as they are part of application logging. Code formatting is consistent throughout project.
