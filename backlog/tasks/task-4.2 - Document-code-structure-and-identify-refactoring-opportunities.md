## Description

Analyze and document the current code structure with focus on functionality mapping and identifying areas of logic complexity that need refactoring into smaller modules and functions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Code structure documented with functionality mapping
- [ ] Areas of high complexity identified
- [ ] Refactoring opportunities documented for navigation types
- [ ] Module boundaries proposed for feature encapsulation

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze source code files (background.ts, content.ts, url_cleaning.ts)\n2. Map functionality to code modules\n3. Identify code complexity and coupling issues\n4. Document areas needing refactoring\n5. Propose module boundaries for better encapsulation\n6. Identify opportunities for separating navigation types\n7. Create refactoring recommendations document
