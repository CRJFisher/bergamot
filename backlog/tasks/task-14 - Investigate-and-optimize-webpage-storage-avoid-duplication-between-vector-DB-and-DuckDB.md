## Description

Currently we may be storing parsed webpage content in both the vector database and DuckDB. This investigation will determine if we can optimize storage by keeping content only in the vector DB, which would require implementing key-based lookups in the vector store.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Current storage pattern for webpage content is documented
- [ ] Determination made on whether content is duplicated between vector DB and DuckDB
- [ ] If duplication exists - feasibility of vector DB key-based lookups assessed
- [ ] Implementation plan created for optimized storage (vector DB only if feasible)
- [ ] Storage efficiency gains quantified
