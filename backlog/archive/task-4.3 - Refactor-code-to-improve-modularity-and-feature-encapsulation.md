## Description

Perform the identified refactoring to improve code modularity, with special focus on encapsulating different types of navigation functionality into separate modules

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Navigation handling refactored into separate modules
- [x] Complex logic broken down into smaller functions
- [x] Feature encapsulation improved throughout codebase
- [x] Code maintains backward compatibility
- [x] All tests pass after refactoring

## Implementation Plan

1. Create core module structure directories
2. Extract TabHistoryManager from background.ts
3. Extract NavigationDetector from content.ts
4. Create MessageRouter for centralized messaging
5. Extract DataCollector for content handling
6. Create ConfigurationManager for settings
7. Separate navigation types into modules
8. Update imports and wire modules together
9. Test refactored code maintains functionality

## Implementation Notes

Successfully refactored the browser extension code into modular components:

**Created Core Modules**:

- `TabHistoryManager`: Manages tab navigation state and history tracking
- `NavigationDetector`: Unified SPA navigation detection with multiple mechanisms
- `MessageRouter`: Centralized message handling between content and background scripts
- `DataCollector`: Handles content extraction and compression
- `ConfigurationManager`: Manages configuration and environment settings
- `APIClient`: Handles server communication

**Key Improvements**:

- Separated concerns: Each module has a single responsibility
- Improved testability: Private methods can be tested through public APIs
- Cleaner architecture: background.ts reduced from 288 to 18 lines
- Better encapsulation: Navigation detection logic isolated from data handling
- Type safety: Created proper TypeScript interfaces in types/navigation.ts

**Maintained Compatibility**:

- All existing functionality preserved
- Unit tests updated and passing
- Build process successful
- Same API endpoints and message formats
