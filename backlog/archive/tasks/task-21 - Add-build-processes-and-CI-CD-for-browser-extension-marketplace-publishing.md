## Description

Implement automated build and publishing pipeline for browser extensions to Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Edge Add-ons, Brave and other browsers which we can support (given the extension APIs that we rely on). This includes setting up CI/CD workflows, build scripts, and marketplace configurations to enable automatic or semi-automatic publishing of the browser extension to all major browser stores.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Build scripts for browser extension packaging
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds
- [x] Chrome Web Store publishing configuration
- [x] Firefox Add-ons publishing configuration
- [x] Edge Add-ons publishing configuration
- [x] Opera Add-ons publishing configuration (if feasible)
- [x] Version management and changelog generation
- [x] Automated testing before publishing
- [x] Store listing assets (descriptions icons screenshots)
- [x] Publishing documentation for manual steps
- [x] Secrets management for store API keys
- [x] Build artifacts stored for each release

## Implementation Plan

1. Create build scripts for browser extension packaging (production builds with minification)
2. Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds and releases
3. Configure Chrome Web Store publishing with API integration
4. Configure Firefox Add-ons publishing with web-ext tool
5. Configure Edge Add-ons publishing (uses Chrome Web Store package)
6. Evaluate and configure Opera Add-ons if compatible
7. Implement version management using package.json and automatic changelog
8. Integrate existing tests into publishing pipeline
9. Create store listing assets (icons, screenshots, descriptions)
10. Document manual publishing steps and API key setup
11. Configure GitHub Secrets for store credentials
12. Set up GitHub Releases for build artifacts

## Implementation Notes

## Implementation Completed

### Build Scripts Created

- **browser/scripts/build-production.js**: Production build script with minification and automatic packaging
- **browser/scripts/version-bump.js**: Version management and changelog generation
- **browser/scripts/publish-chrome.js**: Chrome Web Store publishing automation
- **browser/scripts/publish-firefox.js**: Firefox Add-ons publishing automation
- **browser/scripts/publish-edge.js**: Edge Add-ons publishing automation

### GitHub Actions Workflow

- **.github/workflows/browser-extension-publish.yml**: Complete CI/CD pipeline
  - Triggered on version tags (v*.*.\*)
  - Runs comprehensive tests before build
  - Builds for all target browsers
  - Publishes to stores automatically
  - Creates GitHub releases with artifacts
  - Supports manual workflow dispatch

### Store Configurations

- Chrome Web Store: OAuth2-based API integration
- Firefox Add-ons: web-ext tool integration
- Edge Add-ons: Azure AD authenticated API
- Opera: Compatible with Chrome package (manual submission)

### Version Management

- Automated version bumping (patch/minor/major)
- Automatic changelog generation from git commits
- Manifest.json version synchronization
- Semantic versioning support

### Assets and Documentation

- **browser/assets/**: Store listing assets structure
- **browser/assets/store-listings/**: Platform-specific descriptions
- **browser/PUBLISHING.md**: Comprehensive publishing guide
- **.github/SECRETS_SETUP.md**: GitHub secrets configuration guide

### Package.json Updates

- Added production build scripts
- Added publishing scripts for each platform
