## Description

Set up automated publishing of the VSCode extension to both the official VSCode Marketplace and Open VSX Registry. This includes creating a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment and documenting any manual steps required for the initial setup and ongoing maintenance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] VSCode extension published to official VSCode Marketplace
- [x] VSCode extension published to Open VSX Registry (open-vsx.org)
- [x] CI/CD pipeline configured for automated publishing on releases
- [x] Personal Access Tokens (PATs) securely stored as CI secrets
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow created for marketplace publishing
- [x] Manual setup steps documented in task implementation notes
- [x] Version bumping and changelog generation automated
- [x] Pre-publish validation checks implemented (linting testing building)
- [x] Publishing triggered by GitHub release or tag creation
- [x] Both marketplaces stay in sync with same version numbers

## Implementation Plan

## Research Findings

### Main Distribution Channels

1. **VS Code Marketplace** (Microsoft Official)

   - Primary marketplace with 30,000+ extensions
   - Uses Azure DevOps for authentication
   - Requires Personal Access Token (PAT)
   - Publishing via vsce CLI tool
   - Supports automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions

2. **Open VSX Registry** (Eclipse Foundation)

   - Open-source alternative marketplace
   - Vendor-neutral, community-driven
   - Uses ovsx CLI tool for publishing
   - Requires Eclipse account and publisher agreement
   - Token-based authentication

3. **Alternative Distribution Methods**
   - Direct VSIX file distribution via GitHub Releases
   - Private NPM registries (Nexus, Verdaccio)
   - Self-hosted marketplaces (code-marketplace by Coder)
   - Local workspace extensions (.vscode/extensions/)
   - Corporate artifact repositories (JFrog Artifactory)

### Implementation Strategy

1. Create production build scripts for VS Code extension
2. Implement versioning with semantic-release
3. Set up dual publishing to VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX
4. Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
5. Add VSIX artifacts to GitHub Releases
6. Create comprehensive documentation
7. Set up authentication tokens securely
8. Add pre-publish validation and testing

## Implementation Notes

## Implementation Completed

### Research Summary

Conducted comprehensive research into VS Code extension distribution:

- **Primary Marketplaces**: VS Code Marketplace (30M+ users) and Open VSX Registry (open source)
- **Alternative Methods**: GitHub Releases, private NPM registries, direct VSIX distribution
- **Authentication**: PAT-based for both marketplaces
- **Tools**: vsce (VS Code) and ovsx (Open VSX) CLI tools

### Scripts Created

- **vscode/scripts/build-production.js**: Production build with validation and packaging
- **vscode/scripts/version-bump.js**: Semantic versioning and changelog generation
- **vscode/scripts/publish-vscode.js**: VS Code Marketplace publishing automation
- **vscode/scripts/publish-openvsx.js**: Open VSX Registry publishing automation

### GitHub Actions Workflow

- **.github/workflows/vscode-extension-publish.yml**: Complete CI/CD pipeline
  - Triggered on vscode-v*.*.\* tags
  - Runs comprehensive tests and linting
  - Builds and validates extension
  - Publishes to both marketplaces
  - Creates GitHub releases with VSIX artifacts
  - Supports manual workflow dispatch

### Package.json Updates

- Added build and publishing scripts
- Added ovsx as dev dependency
- Configured version management commands

### Documentation Created

- **vscode/PUBLISHING.md**: Comprehensive publishing guide
  - Setup instructions for both marketplaces
  - Build and version management procedures
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - Alternative distribution methods
- **.github/VSCODE_SECRETS_SETUP.md**: Detailed secrets configuration
  - Step-by-step PAT generation
  - GitHub secrets setup
  - Security best practices
  - Token rotation procedures

### Key Features Implemented

- Dual marketplace publishing (VS Code + Open VSX)
- Automated version bumping with changelog
- Pre-publish validation checks
- Production build optimization
- VSIX artifact generation and storage
- GitHub Release integration
- Manual and automated publishing options
- Comprehensive error handling

### Manual Setup Required (One-time)

1. Create Azure DevOps account and publisher
2. Generate VSCE_PAT with Marketplace:Manage scope
3. Create Open VSX account and sign agreement
4. Generate OVSX_PAT from user settings
5. Add both PATs as GitHub secrets
6. Update package.json with publisher ID

### Publishing Workflow

1. Bump version: npm run version:patch/minor/major
2. Commit and push changes
3. Create tag: git tag vscode-vX.Y.Z
4. Push tag: git push --tags
5. Automatic publishing via GitHub Actions

### Modified/Created Files

- vscode/package.json (updated scripts)
- vscode/scripts/\*.js (4 new scripts)
- .github/workflows/vscode-extension-publish.yml (new)
- vscode/PUBLISHING.md (new)
- .github/VSCODE_SECRETS_SETUP.md (new)
