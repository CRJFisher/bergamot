## Description

Add comprehensive test coverage for all modules, focusing on untested code paths and edge cases

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Test coverage report generated showing current baseline
- [x] Test coverage increased to >80% for all modules
- [x] All critical paths have unit tests
- [x] Integration tests added for main workflows
- [x] Edge cases and error conditions tested
- [x] Mocking strategy documented for external dependencies

## Implementation Notes

Fixed all failing tests across the codebase:
- Fixed critical bug in DuckDB query method (was using 'run' instead of 'runAndReadAll')
- Fixed foreign key constraint handling in DuckDB
- Fixed procedural memory store parameterized query issues and BigInt conversions
- Fixed root node detection logic in webpage_tree.ts
- Removed 4 permanently skipped tests due to documented DuckDB limitations
- Final result: 16 test suites passing, 284 tests passing, 0 failures, 0 skipped
- All test files now have proper test isolation using in-memory databases
- Fixed mock implementations and test data setup across multiple files
