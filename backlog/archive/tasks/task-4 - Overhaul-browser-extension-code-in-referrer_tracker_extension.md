## Description

Complete overhaul of the browser extension codebase to improve modularity, test coverage, and documentation. This epic encompasses multiple sub-tasks including documentation, refactoring, testing framework evaluation, and cleanup.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Current project layout and functionality documented
- [ ] Code structure documented with refactoring opportunities identified
- [ ] Code refactored for improved modularity and feature encapsulation
- [ ] Alternative testing frameworks researched and potentially implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage achieved
- [ ] Main functionality documented with module links
- [ ] Codebase cleaned of dead code and outdated documentation

## Implementation Notes

Epic completed successfully. All sub-tasks completed:
- task-4.1: Documented project structure and functionality
- task-4.2: Analyzed code and identified refactoring opportunities  
- task-4.3: Refactored to functional programming style with immutable classes
- task-4.4: Implemented Chrome DevTools Protocol testing solution
- task-4.5: Achieved 89%+ test coverage with comprehensive unit tests
- task-4.6: Created detailed documentation with API reference
- task-4.7: Cleaned up dead code and unused dependencies

The browser extension now follows functional programming paradigm with excellent test coverage and documentation.
