## Description

Expose the webpage vector database through the MCP server as a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) service that can be queried for relevant webpage content

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] RAG endpoint added to MCP server
- [x] Vector DB query functionality exposed
- [x] Relevance search implemented
- [x] Response formatting for RAG queries
- [ ] ~~Authentication/authorization if needed~~
  - Can use stdio transport for MCP communication if needed
- [x] API documentation for RAG service

## Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Design RAG endpoint architecture
2. ✅ Implement semantic_search tool for vector similarity search
3. ✅ Implement get_webpage_content tool for retrieving specific pages
4. ✅ Add proper error handling and validation
5. ✅ Create standalone MCP server process
6. ✅ Integrate MCP server lifecycle with VSCode extension
7. ✅ Write comprehensive tests
8. ✅ Document MCP tools usage with examples

## Implementation Notes

The MCP server implementation was already largely complete when this task was started. The following components were verified and documented:

### Features Implemented

1. **MCP Server Architecture**:

   - Main server class: in `src/mcp_server.ts`
   - Standalone server: for process isolation
   - Integration with VSCode extension lifecycle in `src/mcp_server_lifecycle.ts`

2. **RAG Tools Exposed**:

   - `semantic_search`: Vector similarity search using LanceDB and OpenAI embeddings
   - `get_webpage_content`: Retrieve full webpage content by session ID

3. **Data Flow**:

   - Webpages are processed and stored in LanceDB during the workflow (see `src/workflow.ts`)
   - Memory store uses OpenAI text-embedding-3-small model for embeddings
   - Fallback to DuckDB for content not in vector store

4. **Error Handling**:

   - Proper McpError types for different failure scenarios
   - Graceful degradation when content not found
   - Comprehensive error messages

5. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests in `src/mcp_server.test.ts`
   - All tests passing with good coverage

### Technical Decisions

- Chose to run MCP server as separate process for better isolation
- Used stdio transport for MCP communication
- Implemented both memory store and DuckDB fallback for robustness

### Files Modified

- Main server implementation
- Standalone process entry point
- Integration with VSCode lifecycle
- Unit tests
- User documentation

### Authentication Note

Authentication/authorization was not implemented as the MCP server runs locally and is only accessible to the user's own AI agents. This could be added in the future if needed for shared deployments.
