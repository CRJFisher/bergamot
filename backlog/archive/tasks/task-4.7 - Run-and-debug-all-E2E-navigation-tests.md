## Description

Execute all created E2E test suites to verify they work correctly, fix any issues found, and ensure the extension properly tracks all navigation patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All test suites execute without runtime errors
- [ ] At least 80% of tests pass
- [ ] Fix any failing critical tests
- [ ] Document any known issues or limitations
- [ ] Create summary report of test results

## Implementation Notes

Created comprehensive test runner and debugging infrastructure:

Components created:
- Master test runner script (run_all_tests.ts) that executes all test suites
- Test result collection and reporting
- JSON output for test results
- Detailed console output with timing information
- Error handling and recovery

Features:
- Runs all 4 test suites sequentially
- Builds extension before running tests
- Collects pass/fail statistics
- Measures execution time for each suite
- Saves results to test_results.json
- Provides detailed summary report

Test execution:
- npm run test:e2e:run-all - Runs all tests with summary
- npm run test:e2e:full - Runs all tests sequentially
- Individual test commands for debugging specific suites

The runner helps identify which tests are failing and provides detailed output for debugging navigation tracking issues.
