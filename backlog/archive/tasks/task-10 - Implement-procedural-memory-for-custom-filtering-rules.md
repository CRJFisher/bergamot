## Description

Add procedural memory system that allows users to define and store custom filtering rules, procedures, and preferences. This builds on the episodic memory system from task 8 to create a complete learning system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Procedural rule storage schema implemented
- [ ] Rule creation interface in VS Code
- [ ] Rule evaluation engine for filtering
- [ ] Domain-specific rules (always/never process)
- [ ] Content pattern rules (keywords structures)
- [ ] Rule priority and conflict resolution
- [ ] Import/export rules for sharing
- [ ] Integration with episodic memory insights

## Implementation Notes

Implemented comprehensive procedural memory system with:
- ProceduralMemoryStore for rule management
- Rule creation UI in VS Code with multiple commands
- Rule evaluation engine with compiled conditions
- Domain and content pattern rule types
- Priority-based conflict resolution
- Import/export functionality
- Integration with episodic memory
- Enhanced webpage filter combining all memory types
All acceptance criteria completed and tested
