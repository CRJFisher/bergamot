## Description

Break down the audit into manageable subtasks for systematic execution

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Subtask created for dead code removal
- [ ] Subtask created for type safety improvements
- [ ] Subtask created for test coverage enhancement
- [ ] Subtask created for coding standards application
- [ ] Subtask created for performance optimization

## Implementation Notes

Created all necessary subtasks for the code audit:
- 18.2: Remove dead code and unused dependencies
- 18.3: Replace TypeScript 'any' types
- 18.4: Increase test coverage to 80%+
- 18.5: Apply snake_case naming convention
- 18.6: Refactor complex functions
- 18.7: Document public APIs
- 18.8: Optimize performance bottlenecks

Each subtask has clear acceptance criteria and can be executed independently.
