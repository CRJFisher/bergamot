## Description

Create test harness, utilities, and mock server for E2E browser extension testing.

This is already mostly done - we have CDP test infrastructure setup already.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test utilities for navigation verification
- [ ] Helper functions for extension interaction

## Implementation Notes

Created comprehensive E2E test infrastructure:

- TestServer class with mock endpoints for various website types (SPA, traditional, PJAX, hash routing, iframes)
- NavigationE2ETestSuite with 10 test suites covering all navigation scenarios
- NavigationVerifier and helper utilities for tracking and verifying navigation chains
- Integration with existing CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) infrastructure
- Added express dependencies and npm scripts for running E2E tests

Files created:

- browser/e2e/test-server.ts - Mock server with test endpoints
- browser/e2e/navigation_e2e_tests.ts - Comprehensive E2E test suite
- browser/e2e/navigation_helpers.ts - Helper utilities for navigation testing

The infrastructure supports testing of:

- Traditional multi-page navigation
- SPA navigation (pushState/replaceState)
- GitHub-like PJAX navigation
- Multi-tab navigation chains with opener tracking
- Hash-based routing
- Iframe navigation
- Popup windows
- Form submissions
- Server and meta redirects
- Referrer and navigation metadata
