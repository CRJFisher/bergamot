## Description

Create extensive end-to-end tests for the browser extension covering various website types, navigation patterns, and edge cases to ensure navigation chains are captured correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test suite covers SPA navigation (GitHub
- [ ] React apps)
- [ ] Test suite covers multi-tab navigation chains
- [ ] Test suite covers traditional multi-page websites
- [ ] Test suite covers iframe and popup scenarios
- [ ] Test suite covers browser back/forward navigation
- [ ] Test suite covers direct URL entry
- [ ] Test suite covers link clicks with modifiers (ctrl/cmd+click)
- [ ] All tests run reliably in CI/CD
- [ ] Documentation for running and extending tests

## Implementation Notes

Successfully created comprehensive E2E browser extension testing infrastructure:

Sub-tasks completed:
1. ✅ Task 4.1: Set up E2E test infrastructure
2. ✅ Task 4.2: Test SPA navigation tracking  
3. ✅ Task 4.3: Test multi-tab navigation chains
4. ✅ Task 4.4: Test traditional website navigation
5. ✅ Task 4.5: Test edge cases and special scenarios
6. ✅ Task 4.6: Test referrer and navigation metadata
7. ✅ Task 4.7: Run and debug all E2E navigation tests

Key deliverables:
- TestServer class providing mock endpoints for various website types
- NavigationE2ETestSuite covering 10 navigation scenarios
- SPANavigationTestSuite with 10 SPA-specific tests
- MultiTabNavigationTestSuite with 10 multi-tab tests
- EdgeCasesTestSuite with 12 edge case scenarios
- NavigationVerifier and helper utilities
- Master test runner for all suites
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

Test coverage includes:
- Traditional multi-page navigation
- SPA navigation (React, Vue, Angular patterns)
- GitHub-style PJAX navigation
- Multi-tab relationships and opener tracking
- Hash-based routing
- Iframe navigation
- Popup windows
- Form submissions
- Redirects (server, meta, JavaScript)
- Referrer and metadata tracking
- Edge cases and error conditions

Infrastructure features:
- Chrome DevTools Protocol integration
- Express-based mock server
- Puppeteer/CDP automation
- Test result reporting
- Performance metrics
- Cross-platform CI/CD

The comprehensive test suite ensures the browser extension correctly tracks all types of web navigation patterns and maintains proper navigation groups and relationships.
