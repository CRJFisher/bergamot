## Description

Set up continuous integration and deployment pipeline for automated E2E testing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow configured
- [ ] Tests run on multiple OS (Linux macOS Windows)
- [ ] Tests run on multiple Node versions
- [ ] Test results uploaded as artifacts
- [ ] Summary reports generated

## Implementation Notes

Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow for E2E testing:

File created:
- .github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml

Features:
- Multi-OS testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- Multi-Node version testing (18.x, 20.x)
- Automatic Chrome installation on all platforms
- Dependency caching for faster builds
- Unit and E2E test execution
- Test result artifact upload
- Summary report generation
- Combined test report across all matrix combinations
- Failure detection and reporting

Workflow triggers:
- Push to main and develop branches
- Pull requests to main branch
- Only runs when browser/ or vscode/ files change

The CI/CD pipeline ensures all navigation tracking tests run automatically on every code change across multiple environments.
