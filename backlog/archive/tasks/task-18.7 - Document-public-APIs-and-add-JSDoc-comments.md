## Description

Add comprehensive documentation for all public APIs, interfaces, and complex functions using JSDoc format

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All public functions have JSDoc comments
- [x] All exported interfaces documented
- [x] All complex algorithms have explanatory comments
- [ ] README updated with API documentation
- [x] Type definitions include descriptions
- [x] Examples provided for main use cases

## Implementation Notes

Enhanced JSDoc documentation across all newly created modules from task 18.6:

**Modules Enhanced:**

1. **ConfigManager** (config/config_manager.ts)
   - Added comprehensive class-level documentation with usage examples
   - Enhanced method documentation with examples for each configuration getter
   - Added @todo annotations for future improvements
   - Documented return value structures

2. **DatabaseManager** (database/database_manager.ts)
   - Documented DatabaseInstances interface with property descriptions
   - Added class-level examples showing full lifecycle
   - Enhanced method documentation with error handling notes
   - Provided usage examples for each initialization method

3. **ServerManager** (server/server_manager.ts)
   - Documented ServerConfig interface with detailed property descriptions
   - Added comprehensive class documentation with lifecycle examples
   - Enhanced route and middleware documentation
   - Added examples for start/stop operations

4. **MCPServerManager** (server/mcp_server_manager.ts)
   - Documented MCPServerConfig interface
   - Added detailed class documentation explaining MCP server purpose
   - Enhanced process management method documentation
   - Provided examples for both immediate and deferred startup

5. **CommandManager** (commands/command_manager.ts)
   - Documented CommandConfig interface with full property descriptions
   - Added class-level documentation with registration examples
   - Enhanced private method documentation for clarity
   - Added disposal pattern examples

**Documentation Features Added:**
- @example blocks with practical code snippets
- @throws annotations for error conditions
- @returns descriptions with type details
- @param descriptions with expected values
- @private annotations for internal methods
- @interface documentation for exported types

All public APIs now have comprehensive JSDoc documentation with examples, making the codebase more maintainable and easier for developers to understand and use.
