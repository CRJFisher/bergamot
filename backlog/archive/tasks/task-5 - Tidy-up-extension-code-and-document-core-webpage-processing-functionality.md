## Description

Document the core functionality of the extension (listening to web page browse events, processing them using a workflow, adding them to a vector db) then remove all other dead code from /src

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core functionality documented (browse event listening
- [ ] workflow processing
- [ ] vector db storage)
- [ ] Dead code identified and removed from /src
- [ ] Clean architecture with only essential components

## Implementation Plan

1. Explore /src directory to understand current codebase structure
2. Identify core webpage processing functionality
3. Document the browse event listening mechanism
4. Document the workflow processing pipeline
5. Document vector DB storage implementation
6. Identify and remove dead code
7. Create architecture documentation

## Implementation Notes

Documented core webpage processing functionality:

- Created WEBPAGE_PROCESSING_ARCHITECTURE.md documenting the complete data flow
- Identified three main components: browse event listening (browser extension), workflow processing (VS Code extension), and storage (Vector DB + DuckDB)
- Created DEAD_CODE_ANALYSIS.md identifying removable files

Removed dead code:

- Deleted suggestion_decorations.ts (entirely commented out)
- Deleted suggestions_page_decorations.ts (entirely commented out)  
- Deleted home_page.ts (entirely commented out)
- Cleaned up extension.ts by removing unused repopulate_home_page function

Core functionality preserved:

- Browser extension captures visits with referrer tracking
- Express server receives compressed webpage data
- Workflow processes pages through LangGraph pipeline
- Data stored in both DuckDB (structured) and LanceDB (vectors)
- MCP server exposes RAG functionality
