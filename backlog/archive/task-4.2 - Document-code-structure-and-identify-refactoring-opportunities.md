## Description

Analyze and document the current code structure with focus on functionality mapping and identifying areas of logic complexity that need refactoring into smaller modules and functions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Code structure documented with functionality mapping
- [x] Areas of high complexity identified
- [x] Refactoring opportunities documented for navigation types
- [x] Module boundaries proposed for feature encapsulation

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze source code files (background.ts, content.ts, url_cleaning.ts)
2. Map functionality to code modules
3. Identify code complexity and coupling issues
4. Document areas needing refactoring
5. Propose module boundaries for better encapsulation
6. Identify opportunities for separating navigation types
7. Create refactoring recommendations document

## Implementation Notes

Created comprehensive code analysis in `backlog/docs/browser-extension-code-analysis.md` that includes:

- **Code Structure Analysis**: Documented all three main modules with their responsibilities and key functions
- **Complexity Identification**: Identified high-complexity areas in tab history management, SPA navigation detection, and configuration
- **Navigation Type Separation**: Proposed four distinct navigation modules (Standard, SPA, Tab, Link)
- **Module Boundaries**: Designed five core modules (TabHistoryManager, NavigationDetector, MessageRouter, DataCollector, APIClient)
- **Refactoring Priorities**: Categorized improvements into high, medium, and low priority

Key findings:

- Background script has duplicate logic and mixed concerns
- Content script has overlapping SPA detection mechanisms
- No proper error handling or retry mechanisms
- Excessive logging without proper levels
- Configuration management needs centralization
