- **Link Hover Tooltips**: Show webpage metadata when hovering over links
- Both features fully integrated with existing storage system

#### 5. **Task 9**: MCP Server RAG Implementation ‚úÖ
- Verified MCP server exposes webpage vector database
- Provides semantic search via MCP protocol
- Integrates with LanceDB for vector search

### üì¶ Packaging & Testing Infrastructure

#### Scripts Created:
- `scripts/package-all.sh` - Bash script with colored output
- `scripts/package-all.js` - Cross-platform Node.js version
- `scripts/test-all.sh` - Comprehensive test suite
- `native-host/install.sh` - Native host installation script

#### NPM Commands:
```bash
npm run package:all       # Package all extensions
npm run package:vscode    # Package VS Code extension only
npm run package:chrome    # Package Chrome extension only
npm run package:firefox   # Package Firefox extension only
npm run release:prepare   # Complete release preparation
```

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Flattened to root-level projects
   - `/vscode` - VS Code extension
   - `/browser` - Browser extensions (Chrome/Firefox)
   - `/native-host` - Native messaging bridge

2. **Communication Architecture**:
   - Primary: Native messaging (secure, reliable)
   - Fallback: HTTP (compatibility)
   - Dynamic port allocation for VS Code server

3. **Memory System**:
   - Episodic memory for learning from user corrections
   - Procedural memory for custom filtering rules
   - Enhanced filter combining both memory types

### üß™ Test Coverage

- **Procedural Memory Tests**: Complete coverage of rule CRUD, evaluation, and statistics
- **Enhanced Filter Tests**: Integration testing with episodic and procedural memory
- **Native Messaging Tests**: Unit tests for browser service and Python host
- **All TypeScript code compiles** without errors

### üöÄ Ready for Publishing

The project is now ready for distribution:

1. **VS Code Marketplace**: Upload `vscode/pkm-assistant-0.1.0.vsix`
2. **Chrome Web Store**: Upload `browser/chrome-extension.zip`
3. **Firefox Add-ons**: Upload `browser/firefox-extension.zip`

### üìù Configuration Notes

**Native Messaging** (Optional Enhancement):
- Install with: `cd native-host && ./install.sh`
- Update extension IDs in manifest files
- System works without configuration (HTTP fallback)

**Default Behavior**:
- Native messaging attempted first
- Automatic fallback to HTTP
- No user configuration required

### üéâ Summary
