# E2E Test Status Report

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Test server successfully serves mock websites
   - Chrome launches with extension loaded
   - Console message capture working
   - Navigation tracking detected

2. **Fixed Issues**
   - ESM module compatibility resolved (using tsx)
   - __dirname polyfills added for import.meta.url
   - Test auto-execution on import prevented
   - Single Chrome instance (not duplicate)

3. **Working Test**
   - `npx tsx e2e/working_e2e_test.ts` - Successfully runs and tracks navigation
   - Extension loads and initializes
   - Navigation events are captured
   - Console logs show PKM tracking activity

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Original Tests Using External URLs**
   - Tests try to navigate to `https://example.com` instead of local server
   - Need to update all tests to use `TestServer` URLs

2. **VS Code Server Connection**
   - Extension tries to send data to `http://localhost:5000/visit`
   - Fails because VS Code server isn't running during tests
   - This is expected behavior - could mock the server for complete testing

3. **Test Execution**
   - Tests run with visible Chrome window (not headless by default)
   - Can be made headless with `setup({ headless: true })`

## 📝 Next Steps to Fix All Tests

1. Update all test files to use local TestServer URLs instead of external sites
2. Consider mocking the VS Code server endpoint for complete E2E testing
3. Add headless mode option to all test suites
4. Fix the navigation_e2e_tests.ts and other suites to use proper URLs

## 🎯 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Working test
npx tsx e2e/working_e2e_test.ts

# Simple server test
npx tsx e2e/simple_test.ts

# Individual suites (need URL fixes)
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:e2e:spa
npm run test:e2e:multi-tab
npm run test:e2e:edge

# Run all (needs fixes)
npm run test:e2e:run-all
```

## 📊 Test Coverage Status

| Test Suite | Status | Issue |
|------------|--------|-------|
| TestServer | ✅ Working | - |
| ExtensionTestRunner | ✅ Working | - |
| working_e2e_test.ts | ✅ Working | - |
| navigation_e2e_tests.ts | ❌ Needs Fix | Uses external URLs |
| spa_navigation_tests.ts | ❌ Needs Fix | Uses external URLs |
| multi_tab_navigation_tests.ts | ❌ Needs Fix | Uses external URLs |
| edge_cases_tests.ts | ❌ Needs Fix | Uses external URLs |

## 💡 Key Insight

The extension IS working and tracking navigation! The issue was not with the extension or Chrome automation, but with:
1. Tests trying to navigate to external URLs
2. Multiple test instances running simultaneously
3. ESM module issues

The core infrastructure is solid and functional.
