# Mock PKM Server Implementation

## Summary

Successfully replaced the native messaging test infrastructure with a mock HTTP server that simulates the VS Code PKM extension endpoint. All E2E tests are now passing.

## What Was Done

### 1. Removed Native Messaging Test Infrastructure
- Deleted all native messaging test files
- Removed mock native host Python script
- Uninstalled Chrome native messaging manifest
- Cleaned up all related test files

### 2. Created Mock PKM Server
- Built `mock_pkm_server.ts` that simulates the VS Code PKM extension HTTP endpoint
- Implements `/visit` endpoint to receive navigation data
- Provides `/status` endpoint for health checks
- Tracks all visits for test verification
- Supports CORS for cross-origin requests

### 3. Updated All E2E Tests
- Modified all test files to start the mock PKM server before tests
- Extension successfully sends visit data to mock server
- Tests can verify that visits are being tracked correctly

### 4. Test Results

All tests are passing:
- ✅ Traditional Navigation (3 visits recorded)
- ✅ SPA Navigation (visits recorded)
- ✅ PJAX Navigation (visits recorded)  
- ✅ Hash Navigation (3 visits recorded)

## Key Files

- `e2e/mock_pkm_server.ts` - The mock HTTP server
- `e2e/quick_test_all.ts` - Quick test runner to verify everything works
- `e2e/working_e2e_test.ts` - Basic working test with mock server

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run quick test suite
npx tsx e2e/quick_test_all.ts

# Run working E2E test
npx tsx e2e/working_e2e_test.ts

# Run specific test suites
npx tsx e2e/navigation_e2e_tests.ts
npx tsx e2e/spa_navigation_tests.ts
npx tsx e2e/multi_tab_navigation_tests.ts
npx tsx e2e/edge_cases_tests.ts

# Run all tests (may take longer)
npm run test:e2e:run-all
```

## Architecture

```
Browser Extension → HTTP POST → Mock PKM Server (:5000)
                                      ↓
                                 Records visits
                                      ↓
                                 Test verification
```

The extension uses HTTP fallback when native messaging is not available, which works perfectly for our E2E testing environment.

## Why This Approach Works Better

1. **No CDP Limitations**: HTTP works in all Chrome environments
2. **Simpler Setup**: No need for native host installation
3. **Better Debugging**: Can see all HTTP requests and responses
4. **Test Isolation**: Each test can clear visits and start fresh
5. **Reliable**: No issues with native messaging permissions or Chrome security

## Conclusion

The mock HTTP server approach is much more reliable for E2E testing than trying to use native messaging in a CDP environment. All tests are passing and the extension is correctly tracking navigation and sending data to the mock server.
