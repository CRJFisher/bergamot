# 06: Security Considerations for MCP

Enabling AI agents to interact with tools and data via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces significant power, but also critical security responsibilities. A robust security posture is essential.

**Why Security is Paramount:**
MCP allows AI to perform actions (e.g., file modification, API calls) and access potentially sensitive data. Without proper security, this can lead to misuse, data breaches, or unintended system behavior. The potential impact of a security flaw in an MCP-enabled system can be severe.

**Key Security Concerns:**

1.  **Prompt Injection:** Maliciously crafted inputs (e.g., in data processed by the AI) can trick the AI agent into performing unauthorized actions or leaking sensitive information.
2.  **Tool Poisoning:** MCP Servers could be malicious or compromised, offering tools that perform harmful actions or exfiltrate data. Trust in Server identity and integrity is crucial.
3.  **Credential Management:** Secure handling of credentials (API keys, tokens) used by Clients or Servers is vital to prevent unauthorized access.
4.  **Isolation and Containment:** Lack of proper sandboxing for AI agents or MCP Servers can lead to a wider system impact if a component is compromised.
5.  **Input Validation:** Servers must rigorously validate all parameters received from Clients to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection).
6.  **Authentication and Authorization:** Robust mechanisms are needed to authenticate Clients and Servers and to authorize specific tool usage for specific Clients.

**Core Security Principles for MCP Ecosystems:**

*   **User Control and Transparency:** Users should be informed and ideally provide consent for significant actions performed by AI agents. Actions should be auditable.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):** AI agents and MCP Servers should operate with the minimum permissions necessary for their tasks.
*   **Strong Authorization:** Verify not just *who* is making a request, but *what* they are allowed to do (e.g., specific tools, specific data).
*   **Server Vetting and Identity:** Implement mechanisms to establish trust in MCP Servers (e.g., code signing, registries).
*   **Rigorous Input Validation and Sanitization:** Servers must treat all client input as untrusted.
*   **Secure Transport:** Use encrypted communication channels (e.g., TLS/SSL) between Clients and Servers.

**Ecosystem Responsibility:**
Security in MCP is a shared responsibility involving Client developers, Server developers, Host environment providers, and users. A defense-in-depth strategy is crucial. The challenges in securing MCP are also driving innovation in AI safety, alignment, and control mechanisms.
