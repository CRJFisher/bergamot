# 04: Typical MCP Interaction Flow

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) facilitates a structured interaction between an MCP Client (typically an AI agent) and an MCP Server (a provider of tools or data). This flow enables the AI agent to leverage external capabilities.

**Conceptual Interaction Steps:**

1.  **Initialization & Connection (Optional):**
    *   The MCP Client may establish a connection with the MCP Server.
    *   Initial negotiation regarding protocol versions or capabilities might occur.

2.  **Discovery of Capabilities:**
    *   The Client sends a request to the Server (e.g., using a predefined MCP method like `mcp.discoverTools`) to learn about the tools, resources, or prompt templates it offers.
    *   The Server responds with a structured list of its capabilities, including names, descriptions, and schemas for parameters and return values (often JSON Schemas). This allows the Client to understand what the Server can do and how to interact with it.

3.  **Tool/Resource Selection by Client (AI Logic):**
    *   Based on its current task or goal, the AI agent (Client) processes the discovered capabilities and decides which tool to use or which resource to access.

4.  **Tool Invocation / Resource Request:**
    *   The Client constructs a JSON-RPC request message specifying the desired tool (as the method name) and providing the necessary parameters.
    *   This request is sent to the Server over an agreed-upon transport mechanism (e.g., HTTP, WebSockets, stdio).

5.  **Execution by Server:**
    *   The Server receives and parses the JSON-RPC request.
    *   It validates the request and parameters.
    *   If valid, the Server executes the corresponding tool logic or retrieves the requested resource.

6.  **Response to Client:**
    *   The Server constructs a JSON-RPC response message containing the result of the tool's execution (or the requested data) or an error object if the request failed.
    *   This response is sent back to the Client.

7.  **Processing by Client:**
    *   The Client receives and processes the Server's response, using the results to continue its task.

**Key Characteristics of the Flow:**
*   **Structured Communication:** Relies on JSON-RPC for clear, machine-readable messages.
*   **Discoverability:** Enables Clients to dynamically learn about Server capabilities.
*   **Transport Agnostic:** The same logical flow can occur over different communication channels.

This interaction pattern allows AI agents to dynamically and flexibly utilize a wide range of external functionalities exposed through MCP Servers.
