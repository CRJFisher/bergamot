# 01: Introduction to the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-standard, open-source framework designed to standardize how Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), integrate and interact with external tools, systems, and data sources.

**Core Problem Addressed:**
Historically, connecting AI models to various tools and data sources required custom integrations for each model-tool pair. This "NÃ—M" integration problem created significant development overhead and limited scalability.

**MCP's Solution:**
MCP offers a model-agnostic, universal interface, often described as "USB-C for AI." It aims to provide a single, standardized way for AI models to communicate with external components, thereby:
*   Eliminating the need for bespoke connectors.
*   Promoting interoperability between different AI models and tools.
*   Reducing complexity in building AI-powered applications.

**Strategic Importance:**
Adopted by key industry players, MCP is becoming a foundational technology for enabling AI agents to perform actions and access information in real-world digital environments. It facilitates the move away from isolated information silos, allowing AI to leverage a broader range of capabilities and data.
